# Qemu-Vortax V1.0

Run any operating system (ISO, QCOW2, or compressed archives) directly on GitHub Actions with full graphical access via **XFCE, RDP, VNC, NoMachine, and Tailscale**.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

**Qemu-Vortax** is an educational and experimental GitHub Actions workflow that allows you to boot and interact with virtual machines in a full graphical desktop environment—right inside the GitHub cloud.  
You can run Linux distributions, Windows builds, or custom disk images using ISO or QCOW2 formats.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 **Multi-OS boot support**: Run any `.iso`, `.qcow2`, or compressed archive (`.zip`, `.7z`, `.rar`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`).
- 💻 **Full GUI desktop (XFCE)** over RDP, VNC, and NoMachine.
- 🛰️ **Secure networking via Tailscale** (your personal encrypted tunnel).
- 📦 **Auto-decompression** for supported archive formats.
- 🔁 **Multiple ready-to-use systems** (see below).
- 🧰 **Dynamic boot type detection** – auto-handles ISO or QCOW2.
- ⏱️ **Session timer** to control VM runtime.
- 🧠 **Custom download sources** (MediaFire, Mega, direct links, etc.).
- 🔒 **Isolated environment** – each run is sandboxed within GitHub Actions.
- 🌐 **Cross-access from any device** – just copy the RDP/VNC/Tailscale link.
- 💾 **Persistent storage simulation** (via temporary QCOW2 disks).
- ⚡ **Fast launch** – VM boots in minutes.

## 🧾 Workflow Inputs

| Input | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `system_choice` | Choose one of the pre-set OS options (see list below) | `ubuntu`, `mint`, `kali`, `deepin` |
| `boot_mode` | Define boot type (`iso` or `qcow2`) | `iso` |
| `source_url` | Custom link (ISO/QCOW2/Archive/MediaFire/Mega) | `https://example.com/myos.iso` |
| `vm_name` | Custom name for your VM session | `my-linux` |
| `runtime` | Session duration in minutes (after setup time) | `180` |

> ⚠️ Important:
> - When using custom links, make sure there are **no spaces** before or after any input.  
> - Always match the **boot mode** with your file type (ISO/QCOW2).  
> - For compressed archives, specify the correct type (ZIP, 7Z, RAR, TAR, TAR.GZ).

## 🖥️ Connection Options

After the VM starts, you’ll see connection details printed in the log:

| Type | Address format | Use |
|------|----------------|-----|
| **RDP** | `ip:3389` | Connect via Remote Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux). |
| **VNC** | `ip:5900` | Use VNC Viewer or Remmina. |
| **NoMachine** | auto-configured | High-speed remote access. |

## ⚡ Performance Tips

- Increase `runtime` for longer sessions.
- Use `qcow2` format for faster boot after first run.
- Use compressed archives only when needed (they add decompression time).
- Always check file integrity before using a custom link.
