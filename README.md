## 🧾 Inputs (Updated for V 2.0)

| Input | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `system_choice` | Pre-set OS to run | `mint`, `ubuntu`, `kali`, `deepin` |
| `boot_mode` | Boot type (`iso` or `qcow2`) | `qcow2` |
| `source_url` | Custom URL (MediaFire, Mega, direct) | `https://example.com/os.iso` |
| `vm_name` | VM name | `test-linux` |
| `runtime` | Session duration in minutes | `335` |
| `connection_method` | `tailscale` or `ngrok` | `tailscale` |
| `connection_program` | `RDP`, `VNC`, `NoMachine` | `VNC` |
| `bios_mode` | Firmware mode (`UEFI` or `BIOS`) | `BIOS` |
| **`vnc_password`** | **Set a password for VNC connection** | `mysecretpass` |
| **`upload_qcow2`** | **Upload QCOW2 file to Mega: yes or no** | `yes` |

> ⚠️ Do not include spaces in URLs 
> The system choice must match the selected `boot_mode` for correct to booting.
> Archives are automatically extracted if supported.
> If you intend to upload the file to Mega after completion, make sure you do not use more than 15 GB of data, as the compressed file may exceed Mega's 20 GB limit.
> If you want to upload a file and you've added files that don't exceed one mega's limit, make sure you have enough time to compress and upload the file. it might take up to 45 minutes before the upload is complete. otherwise you can end up with none unuploaded file

## ⚡ Performance Tips

- Use `qcow2` for faster subsequent boots.
- Longer runtime = longer session before auto shutdown.
- Avoid huge compressed archives for quicker starts.
- Verify links before running custom sources.
- Make sure not to make run time more than 315 min if you want to upload you qcow2 file after finishing 

---

## ☁️ Data Persistence (MEGA Upload)

When `upload_qcow2` is set to `yes`, the following information will be provided in the final run log after the session ends and the file is uploaded:

1. **MEGA Account Credentials:** (Email and Password for the dynamically generated account)
2. **QCOW2 Download Link:** (The direct link to retrieve your compressed VM disk image)
